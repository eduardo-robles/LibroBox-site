Hereâ€™s a list of the files anyone can find inside the Libro Box at the moment. This is list is short and can grow bigger. Remember that the amount files hosted in the Libro Box depends on the size of the USB thumb drive. The bigger the thumb drive the more files the Libro Box can host.

For easy reading I posted the file on Scribd where you can either view, download, or share. As always if you want to send your feed back please email at feedback@rgvlibrobox.com

*This uses the labeling system I discussed earlier.
