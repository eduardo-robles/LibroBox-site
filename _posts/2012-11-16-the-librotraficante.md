In the last post I outlined some of the ideas behind the project and what I ultimately hope to accomplish. In this post I will examine how our project fits into the whole Librotraficante movement (Book Trafficker) taking place across the country.

First, a bit of history on the Librotraficante movement for those who may not be familiar with it. The movement was a response to the Arizona House Bill 2281 which states “HB 2281 prohibits a school district or charter school from including courses or classes that either promote the overthrow of the United States government or promote resentment toward a race or class of people." via Arizona State Legislature.

The ambiguous language of the law caused the banning of 80+ books from the Tucson Unified School District. So the Librotrafincantes “smuggle[d] books back into the hands of our youth,” by collecting books and transporting them by way of a caravan into Arizona. So thus the now famous Librotrafincate Caravan was born.


It was a glorious and peaceful movement that ignited people to mobilize against this common threat. The movement brought attention to frailty that many ethnic studies programs faced across the country. For me it obviously hit home because I protested against the elimination of the Mexican American Studies program at my University. It was under different circumstances but the end result would have been the same.

So I followed closely the Librotrafincate movement did what I could to help spread the word. But I always felt I could do more than just telling people about it. Especially when the movement was asking for help 
“…we have to not only make history, but record it, spread it, and then repeat it" via NewsTaco. Then one day the neurons in my brain linked up and an idea popped up. What if I could use or build a device that could store thousands of books and then share it with anyone for free? That device was the LibraryBox I then knew that this would be my contribution.

So I founded the RGV Libro Box project as a humble contribution to the Librotraficante movement. I feel that the Libro Box can help answer the call made by the Librotrafincate Manifesto. Specifically the the last point in the manifesto which states “We owe it to future generations to create networks and leave in our wake community resources that will last for decades and beyond." via Librotraficante Manifesto.

My interpretation of the last point is that the Librotraficante movement is not only asking to build these networks in the “traditional” sense but to build more “modern” ones. A modern network where a community can access resources in a modern format. This is exactly why I created the RGV Libro Box project. The RGV Libro Box project is building the modern version of the Librotraficante Caravan. If the RGV Libro Box project is successful in the Rio Grande Valley we can take this model to other areas. And ultimately create those networks that can provide future generation valuable community resources. The RGV Libro Box project should not be thought of as a replacement but as a contribution.

So that is where I think the RGV Libro Box project fits into this whole movement. I hope that people understand the intentions behind the RGV Libro Box project and help in making it possible.

Yours truly,
Eduardo
