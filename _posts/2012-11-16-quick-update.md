Today I ordered the router that I will use for testing and developing the Libro Box. This is the first step in getting the project off the ground. When the router comes in I will post some pictures of the unboxing and maybe some video. I plan on making a video to show the installation process and post the results for everyone to see.

Secondly, there is a donations portal on site and you can find it here. The fundraiser is completely optional but it would help if you could contribute. I predict that I will only need to raise enough money (total cost of $124) to build two additional Libro Boxes. Once that goal is reached I will cease the fundraising campaign, all funds raised will only be used to build the two Libro Boxes.

Lastly, I will make it a habit of keeping this site up to date. I created a twitter account for the project, simply follow [@RGVLibroBox](http://www.twitter.com/rgvlibrobox) for updates. If you have any questions or concerns you can email me at Feedback@rgvlibrobox.com.

With that I want to thank those who have already started following the project. I want to thank the LibraryBox Project, without them I could not do the RGV Libro Box project. I want to thank the Librotraficantes who inspired me to start the RGV Libro Box project. I want to thank those who have already reached out and offered support. Lastly, I want to thank in advance all of those who support this project through donations.

Thank you,
Eduardo
