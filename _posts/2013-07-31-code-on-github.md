As a refresher I put up some of the LibroBox landing page design code up on Github. You can find the post here. The post was short and sweet because the Github page is where the real magic happens!

Currently I have another prototype design running on the LibroBox which I have designated as Design 3.0 ! But, that is only a temporary solution for a larger project that I have in mind.

Not so long ago the LibraryBox project started a Kickstarter campaign to raise some funds to continue development of the project. They have successfully raised the funds and even surpassed the original goal by a huge margin! So congrats to them and I wish them luck.

What does that have to do with the future of LibroBox ? Well it simple LibroBox is built on LibraryBox and any advancements in LibraryBox is a good thing for _LibroBox  (whoa! that was packed sentence! :)). So full speed to them and full speed to LibroBox !!

So in the next few weeks I will be heavily concentrated on expanding the original idea of the LibroBox to really get to the crux of the project. The project needs to “connect”, so people can really understand it and embrace it.

I continue to be extremely excited by this project but the goal is to change things in the RGV. What needs to change? I still do not know but there is definitely a void that the LibroBox can fill.

So stick around I promise more exciting things to come!!
