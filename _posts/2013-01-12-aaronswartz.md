Today I heard of the death of Aaron Swartz who committed suicide yesterday. Aaron Swartz was an important figure in the fight for Open Access. His support for an Open Internet and his work to ensure that everyone had access to knowledge will be missed.

I started the RGV Libro Box project because I wanted to fight the privatization of knowledge. I wanted to make access to information as easy and low-cost as possible. I did not know Aaron Swartz personally but his life was important. Every life is important. As someone who also has lost a family member to suicide I feel for his family and friends.

I’ll close by asking that if you or anyone you know is struggling with depression or mental illness please seek help. There’s no shame in it YOUR LIFE IS WORTH IT. Finally, I’ll quote Cory Doctorow in his boing boing post about Aaron Swartz “Where there’s life, there’s hope.”

Peace and Love,
Eduardo
