So What is the Libro Box?

The Libro Box is a custom version of the LibraryBox that the RGV Libro Box Project will build. The Libro Box is essentially a wireless distribution device that enables anyone to download media without the need for an internet connection. This is possible by installing the "LibraryBox" software on the TP-Link MR3020 router. The best part is that the Libro Box does not need to be connected to the Internet to share the educational media inside.

The TP-Link MR3020 router is like any other router, it can become a WiFi hotspot that shares a wireless connection. The underlying ability to share data wirelessly is the key that enables the Libro Box to share educational media wirelessly.

Once the "LibraryBox" software is installed on the TP-Link MR3020 router all you need to do is connect it to a power source and it begins sharing educational media wirelessly. The TP-Link MR3020 is now a Libro Box!

Anyone with a device that can connect to a WiFi hotspot can connect to the Libro Box freely. Once connected to the Libro Box WiFi connection open up a web browser on your device and a homepage will greet you with all the available media that anyone can download freely. And thatâ€™s it.

The above video is a video from the LIbraryBox website explaining how the  device works and showing a demo of the LibraryBox.
