This past Friday the 22nd of February I presented the RGV LibroBox project at the National Association of Chicana Chicano Studies Tejas Foco conference. It was the first conference for me and the first time the Libro Box was presented in public. I have to say that it was a big success not only on a personal level but a professional one as well. I was able to network with some very influential people at the conference.

I had the priviledge to meet Tony Diaz El Librotraficante and the Librotraficante Crew. They are an extremely dedicated group and they do some amazing work. I also met Sarah Rafael Garcia who is doing incredible work with Barrio Writers. Barrio Writers is a great program that helps our youth by providing them with an outlet to express themselves in a safe and encouraging environment.

Overall the conference was exciting and inspiring to experience. It was great to meet so many great people who come from all over the world and share their work/research. Like I said the RGV Libro Box project was received well and I think I will be able to do some collaborations with some other projects. But overall I think the RGV Libro Box project had another effect on people and dare I say on Chicana/o studies. I believe people saw a new expansion of the field into newer fields specifically technology. Not only was my project an innovative technological one but other panelist were exploring tech through the lens of Chicana/o studies. I was excited and others were excited at the level of research and activism  presented at this conference.

So what are the next step for the project after this successful conference. I think the next step is to create stronger ties with the community. If the banning of books is key issue that the RGV Libro Box project wishes to tackle then we must ensure we can do so effectively. If providing open access to information is necessary then we must work to provide accessibility.

But Teotihuacan was not built in one day so careful and effective planning must be made to ensure our goals. I have no doubt that through coalitions and collaborations we can all reach our goals!
