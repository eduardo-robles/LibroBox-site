LibroBox-Design-2.0LibroBox-Design-2.0 - LibroBox Landing Page design 2.0



I’m currently learning how to use Git and GitHub so I can begin to release some of the code I use on the Landing Pages of the LibroBox. I’m a strong believer in the Open Source software principles and I feel it is necessary to share my work with the rest of the community. Offering my humble code back to the community is something that I always aspired to do with the RGV LibroBox project. So I hope someone somewhere can take advantage of this code and use to better their community.
