Firstly, I want to thank the Mexican American Studies Club at the University of Texas Pan American for allowing me to present the LibroBox project.

They are a wonderful student organization doing wonderful things for the college and the community. Through their hard work they have shown that Mexican American Studies is an important aspect of UTPA.
