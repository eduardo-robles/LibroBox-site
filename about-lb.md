**About**

I am Eduardo Robles I graduated from the University of Texas Pan-American in Anthropology and Mexican American Studies. Currently I am pursuing a Masters degree in Information Technology.

In 2012 the Mexican American Studies program at the Tucson Unified School district came under attack. It was ultimately dismantled and the once successful program came to an end. Consequently several important Chicano/a books were banned from Tucson Schools.

I sought for quick improvised solution to the problem of book banning. After months of research I found the LibraryBox Project. Inspired by the “LibraryBox” I plan to build a custom “LibraryBox” which I will call the LibroBox.

The Libro Box is a sans-internet wireless content distribution device. Meaning that the device provides free access to text, audio, video, etc., to anyone who can connect to its WiFi signal.

My passion for technology and community development led me to start this project. Because I believe in using technology as an equalizer I hope to provide valuable information and close the digital divide.
