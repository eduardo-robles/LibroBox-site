The Mcallen Mini Maker Faire was a lot of fun and it was great to talk to all of those who stopped by the booth. It was awesome to see so many people interested in the Maker Movement in the RGV. There’s some great projects out there and some really interesting people behind them.

Overall I’m really glad I got to participate in the Mcallen Mini Maker Faire  and I hope to participate in more local events in the future!
