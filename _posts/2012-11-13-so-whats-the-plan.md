This project is still in it’s early stages but I hope to be as transparent as possible. I believe in being as open and transparent as possible. This way we all learn together and can build a community together.

To start I have a  Project Goals  page where we outline two of the main goals that I hope to accomplish with this project. I see these goals as our "Beta" goals in the sense I plan on expanding on them if they are successful. We all gotta start somewhere right?

The first Project Goal is to give local communities open access to valuable information. I feel strongly that this information must be free of cost to the end user. This information should also be free to distribute by any user. I consider valuable information to be anything revolving around healthcare, law, education, and community development. The idea is simple anyone has the freedom to use and distribute the information inside the Libro Box freely.

The second Project Goal involves the distribution of "Free to Use" Chicano Literature. This goal I see as the hardest one to accomplish. First, I must explain what I mean by "Free to Use". "Free to Use" is a concept that has many definitions but I define "Free to Use" : as anything that can be freely; downloaded, copied, and distributed. I plan on sticking to this definition for as long as I can. But I am open to modifying it in the future if the need arises.

I feel this strategy will be effective in circumventing any efforts to ban Chicano Literature. I know that the academic/professional/proprietary world may have a hard time giving up copyrighted works but copyright was meant to benefit us all not just the artist. Fair warning I am not copyright lawyer, so I welcome anyone who is willing to talk about copyright law or copyrighted material.

The second goal may seem difficult to accomplish but I know it’s not impossible. I just need your help and feedback. If we can accomplish these two "Beta" goals we can then move to replicating the results outside of the Rio Grande Valley. I have my sights set on putting an end to the attack on Chicano Literature. Most importantly I hope to prevent the banning of Chicano Literature.

To wrap up I have given more details on the Project Goals and what I hope to do once they are accomplish them. My overall plan is to ensure that local communities can benefit from this project. So if I am successful in the Rio Grande Valley I plan on expanding it to other locations.
