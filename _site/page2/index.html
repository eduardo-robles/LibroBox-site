        Designing new interface
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Jul 2014</span>

    <p>It’s been some time since I sat down and desinged a new interface for the LibroBox. That’s why this past week I decided to give it another try and it was fun. Mainly because I found a new app that helps me build some quick protypes. The app is called POP and is available for iOS, Android, and via a web interface.</p>

<p>With POP I was able to draw out on paper what I wanted the new interface to look like. Once I was satisfied with my mockup I simply took pictures of each mockup. With POP I was able to “act” out the functionality of each link, page, and even some individual elements.</p>

<p>This is the result. (Hint: It’s interactive!! So go ahead and click on elements on the mockup!)</p>

<p>As you can see the interface is for mobile at the moment. It is also very simple. Before I started creating a mockup I thought about what I wanted to see and what would be best for users. I focused on the core purpose of projects like Librobox (Piratebox, LibraryBox) and determined the content was the most important component. It’s what users ultimately end up needing, using, and sharing.</p>

<p>With this design I wanted the content to be front and center. I also wanted it to be something obvious for new users. There are plenty of new “ideas” on how to serve the content to users. The two main revision I feel I made were the video and chat pages. The video page has a built/pop in player. The chat page has a new interface that looks more like messaging on a phone that a Chatroom.</p>

<p>I also built another mockup extending the idea of the built/pop video player for the audio page.</p>

<p>In the end I am really happy with this new interfaces. I will need to do some research to understand how to implement some of these newer functions. I like the second mockup and may build out this one. But I still have to make some refinements to the design/mockup and then I’ll start coding.</p>
