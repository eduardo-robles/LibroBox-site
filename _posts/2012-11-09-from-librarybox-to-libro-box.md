The idea of what is a Libro Box is kind of hard to explain in words. It’s easier to explain with a hands on demonstration or video. Nonetheless I believe that it is still a good idea to try to explain some of the details of the Libro Box in a post.

First, the Libro Box is simply a re-naming of the LibraryBox, which is a wireless digital distribution device. The Library Box has a D.I.Y feel to it because it is not a commercial device in the sense that you cannot buy a LibraryBox on Amazon. But you can buy the components that will ultimately make a LibraryBox. There are two main components for the LibraryBox, a router and a USB memory stick. That’s it.

The next step is where the D.I.Y component comes into play because a regular router is not a LibraryBox you have to make it a LibraryBox. This is done by installing the LibraryBox software onto the router. This process is relatively simple for those with some relatively savvy tech skills.

If installation of the LibraryBox software is successful the next step is to fill up the USB memory stick with whatever you feel like sharing with people. It can be educational material or just funny pictures of your cat. Connect the USB memory stick to the router in the appropriate port. Then connect the router to power it and turn it on.

If all went well the router should now be broadcasting an open WiFi signal. This signal will show up as a regular open WiFi signal on any device that can connect to the internet. Connect to that open WiFi signal and start the web browser on your device. Once the web browser starts you will be greeted by a web page.

In the final step you simply have to browse the catalog of media on the web page, click on any link at it will begin to download the appropriate file. Once the file is downloaded you can open it up in the appropriate program.

To wrap up, the Libro Box is basically a custom LibraryBox for the RGV Libro Box project. The Libro Box can share files wirelessly with any device that connect to the internet. Anyone can browse and download the files inside freely.
