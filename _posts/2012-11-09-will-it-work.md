Start by doing what’s necessary; then do what’s possible; and suddenly you are doing the impossible. -St. Francis of Assisi

Getting started is always the hardest part when starting a new project. It’s even harder when your project involves real people and the aspiration for “real change”. I wanted to give back to the Rio Grande Valley so we founded the "RGV Libro Box" project.

I needed and wanted to do something to empower low-income households in the Rio Grande Valley. I felt it was necessary to put my skills to good use in my community.

Recently the Mcallen Independent School District was featured in one of Apple’s iPad Mini events. It was featured because Mcallen I.S.D may be the largest school districts in the nation to buy and give all it’s students iPads and iPod Touch. The goal of Mcallen I.S.D was to replace textbooks with a more modern piece of technology that could expand teaching opportunities.

In Weslaco, TX the Weslaco Independent School district has adopted a B.Y.O.T (Bring Your Own Technology) policy. The district wanted to expand it’s current curriculum to incorporate technology in the classrooms to provide a modern atmosphere for it’s students.

Though the Rio Grande Valley has two of the poorest counties in the nation it pushes on to ensure that education in our schools is on pace with modern technology. By investing in modern technology we can invest on our students futures.

It’s still to soon to tell if the adoption of these Hi-Tech teaching methods will work in the Rio Grande Valley. But I feel it’s better to nurture these advancements to ensure their success.

Why not try to incorporate valuable skills like computer programming and data collection with community empowerment? I have seen plenty of examples all over the country of people doing so. Code For America is a perfect example this strategy, its’ like a PeaceCorps for Geeks.

With the help of Libro Box I hope low-income households can gain access to valuable information such as health care information. Local government forms that can be accessed without the need for internet access. The RGV Libro Box Project can work with local school districts to ensure the the Libro Box contains information both parents and students need.

The uses for the Libro Box are endless and can be adapted to fit a variety of scenarios. So to answer the question “Will it work?” I feel it will.
