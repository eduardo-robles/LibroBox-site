Today has been a great day! As of officially announcing the RGV Libro Box Project I have gotten a lot of well wishes and constructive feedback. For that I thank you and encourage more open discussion.

One important piece of feedback I have gotten so far is in regards to submitting work (art, literature, etc) to the project. Before launch I had expressed a preference that any work submitted or added to the Libro Box is to be "Free to Use” : as in anything that can be freely; downloaded, copied, and distributed. But this still left some questions about submitting guidelines/procedures.

So today I am also launching the Submitting Digital Files Guidelines: Version 0.01. This is the first version of the guidelines that I will implement for the RGV Libro Box Project. As with any terms of service it is up for change if needed. For now I feel these general guidelines give a clear picture of how the RGV Libro Box Project will treat others digital/electronic files. The Libro Box is merely a repository of digital/electronic files, nothing more, nothing less.

To give you a real world example of how these guidelines will benefit the contributor and community I came up with the “Digital Art Gallery Week”.  Basically artists will submit their work under the set guidelines. Then I will host the digital/electronic file in the Libro Box for a week. After the week I will remove the specific submissions. This gives artists a digital space to display their work and the community can explore their work. And if all requirements are met then both parties (community and artists) get something out of it.

This is only one example of what can be done with the Libro Box. Like I have said before given the Open Source nature the the Libro Box, I can expand the uses for the project. Overall I think this was a very successful and constructive launch day. Again I thank all of those who reached out and those who help spread the word.
