Building a Libro Box is relatively simple it requires very little components and a few hours of your time. In order to remain transparent as possible I’m going to outline the supplies I plan on using for this project.

Materials List

TP-Link MR3020 router: $40X2
Generic 32GB USB flash drive: $22X2
……………………
total cost=$124
As you can see I included the pricing (rounded up) of each item and multiplied it by how many units this project will need. I plan on building two Libro Box units to help us cover more ground. The first thing on the materials list is the TP-Link MR3020 router which is the backbone of the project. This device will eventually act as a “bridge” or “gateway” for people to wirelessly access data on the device.

Second thing on the materials list is a Generic 32GB USB Flash Drive. Now “Generic” is not a brand I literally mean “generic”, because brand does not matter here. But this project will be needing two of them, one for each Libro Box.

Lastly an Ethernet Cable  would help but is not completely necessary. Nonetheless Ethernet Cable cost roughly $10 for several feet. Though it would be great if someone could donate a big ol’ roll of it. It would cut down on future costs if I expand this project in the future.

As you can see there’s not much that goes into making a Libro Box. The biggest challenge is finding time to build the Libro Box. To open up this project up to the community even more I’m planning a “Hack-Fest" but more on that later.
