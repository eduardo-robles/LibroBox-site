It’s 2013 and I’m starting off the year on a good note. First, I want to give thanks to all of you who started to follow the project in 2012. This is my first project of this kind and it’s definitely a learning experience.

With the start of the new year I think some productive changes are in order. People are naturally stumbling upon the project and are interested in learning more. So I plan on updating the about page to give a more concise and clearer explanation of the project. Some of you may have noticed that this is not a “primary” blog but a “secondary” blog. I have another blog here on Tumblr and RGV Libro Box is a secondary blog from that account. The only issue with this setup is that Tumblr doesn’t give secondary blogs the ability to “follow” people. I’m looking at creating a primary blog or even a whole site for RGV Libro Box but this is not a priority at the moment.

Towards the end of 2012 I was so focused on learning the basics of what makes the LibraryBox (the Code) work that I didn’t have time to apply what I learned. So after learning some neat information I was able to implement a simpler method of categorizing the content inside the Libro Box. So much easier that it makes the my last attempt obsolete. I’ll do a blog post on those changes in the near future.

Also while learning more about the underlying code of the LibraryBox(V-1.5) I feel that it’s not well suited to carry the LibroBox Project into the future. Currently the PirateBox code is seeing more development and giving more support. I am debating whether to build off the original PirateBox code or continue with the LibraryBox code. The LibraryBox code does make it easier to customize the TP-Link MR3020 router. Also the LibraryBox code and philosophy is closer aligned to that of the LibroBox Project. I have not made any final decisions yet, this is just something I am considering.

This year I plan on actually doing field tests and start talking to local libraries and schools about the project. The more I talk to people the more ideas I get on how to improve the project. I hope that this year the dialogue can continue. So those are some plans that I have for the near future. If I can finish them within the time frame I planned out I think it will put the project on solid footing for 2013.
