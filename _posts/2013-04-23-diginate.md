The First Ever DigiNate!!

I am happy to announce a brand new campaign by the RGV Libro Box project, DigiNate!

What’s DigiNate?

-DigiNate is a simple AFK solution to donate your works to the RGV LibroBox project. Digital+Donate=DigiNate

How does it work?

-Simple you come by and I’ll help you either digitize your works or you can donate them directly to us.

When can I DigiNate?

-The first DigiNate will happen this Friday April 26, 2013

Where?

-At the University of Texas Pan American In Edinburg, TX. The RGV Libro Box project will be at the “This is what Diversity looks like” fair hosted by the Mexican American Studies Club. Click the link for more information.

This will be a great opportunity for anyone in the community to learn of the great work being doing by UTPA student organizations.
