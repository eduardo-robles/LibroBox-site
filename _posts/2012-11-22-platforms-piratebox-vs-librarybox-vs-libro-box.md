What is PirateBox?

A PirateBox is a device created by a college professor that allows anyone to connect to a device that allows people to share files anonymously to the PirateBox. It essentially creates a repository of media that people can contribute to and download from. Or think of it as a communal USB memory stick. A USB memory stick where everyone can save files on and download from. And all files can be used, edited, and re-shared with anyone who has access to the USB memory stick.

What is LibraryBox?

A LibraryBox is a device similar to the PirateBox but its purpose is to share specific files with people anonymously. It too is a repository of media but it does not allow people to contribute media to the repository. Think of it a USB memory stick that a friend lends to you so you can download a file from it but you don’t put any files in it.

What is Libro Box?

The Libro Box is a LibraryBox but it will serve as a repository for Chicano literature/media thus inspiring the Spanish name for it.

Wrap Up

Which does the best goals for this project?

The LibraryBox(I call it the Libro Box) is the best for this project because this project wants to share large amounts of data with people without the need for them to share it back.

When did I decide to go with which?

I decided to go with the LibraryBox when we learned of its “use cases” and the flexibility it presented for the project.

Can I use a combination of both or only one?

The PirateBox has some unique features that the Libro Box doesn’t need at the moment. One feature is the ability to share (upload) files to the PirateBox. Since this project is more about giving than receiving I feel the LibraryBox software is better suited. But building a PirateBox required the same exact hardware and software so if the need arises the project can consider using a PirateBox.
